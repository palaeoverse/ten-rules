(2020): The Namba Formation has been correlated with the Etadunna Formation, which has been estimated to be 26-24 Ma old (i.e. latest Oligocene) on the basis of isotopic, foraminiferal, magnetostratigraphic and radiometric (Rb-Sr dating of illite) data. More recently, the Etadunna Formation has been proposed to be 26.1-23.6 Ma old based on a best-fit age-model of magnetostratigraphic data. The Pinpa Local Fauna is the oldest of the three distinct faunal units recovered from stratigraphic levels in the Namba Formation, and has been correlated with the oldest faunal zone (Zone A) of the Etadunna Formation, which has been dated as 25.3-24.9 Ma old (chrons 7An and 7Ar) based on magnetostratigraphy. In summary, available evidence suggests a probable age of between approximately 26 and 25 MYA for the Pinpa Local Fauna.","illite and kaolinite clays","claystone","","","","Y","","","","","","lacustrine indet.","","","macrofossils","","","","","","","","body,original phosphate","","","","","","","","","","","","","taxonomic","","","","","","","","","","marine","","actively mobile","","","carnivore","","","","phosphatic","","",""

Biswas (1992) considered the Naredi Formation to range from late Paleocene to early Eocene in age. While this age estimate may be reasonable at the type section of the formation (where there is neither lignite nor fossil cetaceans), it appears that this is not the case at Panandhro and Akri Lignite Mines. Here, the stratigraphy is more complex and the beds yielding the whales are best included in the Panandhro Formation of Saraswati and Banerjee (1984, preferred here) or the Lakhpat Formation of Mukhopadhyay and Shome (1996). These beds are equivalent in age to the Harudi Formation: middle/late Lutetian. The Domanda Formation of central Pakistan is also Lutetian in age (Gingerich et al., 2001a).\r\n\r\nSaraswati et al. 2014: The present study refers the fossil-bearing strata of Panandhro to planktic zone P12-P13 and the Bartonian Stage. This validates the strontium stratigraphy within the limit of the analytical error. Some of the estimated ages (see Table 1; Ravikant and Bajpai, 2010) are close to the base of the Bartonian (41.2 Ma as per Gradstein et al., 2012). Therefore, the age of the Panandhro fauna is indisputably Bartonian and more so when the authors report them to have been washed down from the overlying beds.","","""shale""","","poorly lithified","silty","Y","","","","","","mire/swamp","","Locality is a pit within the Panandhro lignite mines.","macrofossils","","","","","","","","body","good","","","","","","common","","","","","","taxonomic","surface (float),mechanical,field collection","","all macrofossils","99","","","","","","marine","","actively mobile","","","carnivore","","","","phosphatic","","",""

This suggests the Peligran SALMA might be early Selandian in age. \r\n\r\nAccording to Andreis et al. (1975), the upper sectionof Salamanca Formation (= Hansen Member) in the San Jorge Gulf area was accumulated under infra-littoral and transitional sea conditions. The sediments were accumulated in low energy environments yielded by submarine bars or littoral banks that had reduced the circulation in a sea with little differences between high and low tides. Based on foraminifera, Bertels (1975) assigned the upper levels of the Salamanca Formation to the Upper Danian. This hypothesis was supported by the 40K/40A isotopic age of 61 ± 5Ma obtained from a vitreous tuff belonging to the Hansen Member at the Ca˜nad´on Hondo locality (Andreis 1977; Marshall et al. 1981). This age was subsequently corrected to 62.6 ± 5Ma byMarshall (1982). Additionally, two more reliable radiometric ages sampled by Marshall et al. (1981) in two basaltic units at or just under the base of the Salamanca Formation yielded ages of 64.0 ± 0.8Ma and 62.8 ± 0.8 Ma. Marshall et al.

The ‘‘Eudinoceras’’ in Granger’s sketch were de- scribed as Gobiatherium mirificum (Osborn and Granger, 1932). This species is the dominant taxon in terms of abundance at this site (appendix 3), and it is regarded as one of the index taxa for the Arshantan (Lucas, 2001). We think that the bed that contains Gobiatherium mirificum (‘‘Eudinoceras’’) in Granger’s section is roughly correlative with the beds that yielded Litolophus, Gobiatherium, and Metacoryphodon within the middle beds of the NHA sequence.

Within these beds, some last thin clay layers preserve dessication marks. This matrix is often superficially altered and friable, more compact in-depth. The series includes several beds of this nature, which alternate with thicker deposits of red clays, grayish-red marls, and banks of compact sandstone. Throughout this ensemble, and particularly in the fossiliferous levels, cross-bedded stratifications abound. At the base, the series rests by soft layers (clays?) on an ensemble where compact sandstones dominate in thick banks.

More recently, the Etadunna Formation has been proposed to be 26.1-23.6 Ma old based on a best-fit age-model of magnetostratigraphic data. The Pinpa Local Fauna is the oldest of the three distinct faunal units recovered from stratigraphic levels in the Namba Formation, and has been correlated with the oldest faunal zone (Zone A) of the Etadunna Formation, which has been dated as 25.3-24.9 Ma old (chrons 7An and 7Ar) based on magnetostratigraphy. In summary, available evidence suggests a probable age of between approximately 26 and 25 MYA for the Pinpa Local Fauna.","illite and kaolinite clays","claystone","","","","Y","","","","","","lacustrine indet.","","","macrofossils","","","","","","","","body,original phosphate","","","","","","","","","","","","","taxonomic","","","","","","","","","","marine","","actively mobile","","","carnivore","","","","phosphatic","","",""

The species cited by Filhol (1877, Ann. Sci. Geol. 8, p. 212) as ""<i>Cainotherium commune</i>, E.

They did not name the site. Woodburne and Zinsmeister (1984) named the new genus and species _Antarctodolops dailyi_ on the basis of the same specimens and called the site RV-8200. Both abbreviations refer to the University of California at Riverside. According to Woodburne and Zinsmeister (1984), the collection was made in the summer of 1982.\r\n\r\nAs discussed by Marenssi et al. (1994), scientists of the Departamento Científico de Paleontología de Vertebrados of the Museo de La Plata (DPV-MLP) and of the Instituto Antártico Argentino (IAA) collected fossils on Seymour Island starting in the 1980s. In addition to several new sites, they collected additional specimens at the UCR site, now called DPV 6/84. They mention (p. 5) that American authors also call this site ""IPS locality 445"", the ""Rocket Site"", or the ""Mammal Site"".\r\n\r\nDPV 6/84 is located on the southern side of a canyon unofficially named ""Breakwind Canyon"". Woodburne and Zinsmeister (1984) give the coordinates as 64°13'S, 56°40'W, but these coordinates appear to be in the sea northwest of the island. Maps showing the location of DPV 6/84 were published by several authors, including Woodburne and Zinsmeister (1984, fig. 1), Cione and Reguero (1994: fig. 2), Marenssi et al.

The age model for the La Meseta Formation (and recently-defined Submeseta Formation) is controversial. Strontium isotopes (Ivany et al., 2008) suggest earlier ages, with the La Meseta (Telm1-Telm5) almost entirely Ypresian and the Submeseta (Telm6-Telm7) Middle-Late Eocene. Montes et al. (2013) also created an age model incorporating magnetostratigraphy to support the largely-Ypresian age for the La Meseta and Middle-Late Eocene for the Submeseta. Some mammals are similar to the radiometrically-constrained late early Eocene Paso del Sapo assemblage of Patagonia (Gelfo et al., 2009, Tejedor et al., 2009), but the mammals are not exactly similar (Bond et al., 2011). However, Douglas et al. (2014) re-evaluated the strontium data and used dinoflagellate biostratigraphy to argue for a Lutetian (Telm2-4) and younger (Bartonian to mid-Priabonian for Telm5-6) age range. Amenábar et al. (2019) also found younger ages from dinoflagellates: Lutetian (Telm1-mid Telm 3), Bartonian (mid Telm 3-mid Telm 5), and Priabonian (upper Telm 5), SPDZ10-SPDZ13. This age range is more consistent with the presence of basilosaurid whales in Telm4 and Telm7, as basilosaurids are globally-distributed first in the middle Eocene (Buono et al., 2016). Although the ages are still debated, the dinoflagellate age model of Amenábar et al. (2019) is used here.","Finely laminated beds of silty sandstone, some of which are interbedded with pebbly conglomeratic units interpreted to represent shell banks. The finer-grained beds between the shell banks are finely laminated, and exhibit ripple marks and flaser bedding. Vertical and oblique burrows are common throughout the finer-grained units. Small to large cut-and-fill channel features occur within the sandy siltstone facies. Prominent slump structures and lenses of gravel are associated with these channels. The shell banks consist of individual beds that range in thickness from .5 to 2m, and extend laterally as much as 1km. The banks are characterized by coarse- to fine-grained, well-sorted arkosic sandstone beds that contain pebble- to cobble-sized clasts. Most of the shell banks are extremely fossiliferous.

A study by Wiedman and Feldmann (1988) on the ichnofossil fauna and depositional environment of the La Meseta Formation concluded that the Telm5 setting was a littoral to very shallow sublittoral clastic marine terrain, definitely above storm base and most probably above normal wave base. They agreed with Elliot and Trautrnan (1982) that Units II and III probably represent a tidally dominated environment, but evidence from sedimentary structures is also consistent with a barrier bar model and does not represent a shallowing upward sequence. Elliot and Trautman (1982) favored a deltaic model. The analysis of trace fossils and body fossils (including vertebrate remains and large, abundant wood fragments) indicates variable nearshore, shallow-marine environments. A scenario for the depositional environment could include a combination ebb-tidal (or possibly flood-tidal) delta-barrier island complex (Stilwell & Zinsmeister, 1992).","macrofossils,mesofossils","","","","","","","","body","","allochthonous","time-averaged","","","","","","","","","","taxonomic","sieve,field collection","","some macrofossils","","","IAA, DPV/MLP","1982-1990s","Repository: University of California, Riverside","","marine","","actively mobile","","","carnivore","","","","phosphatic","","",""

""Marshall et al. (1981) indicated that a tuff in the upper part of the Hansen Member yielded a K-Ar date of 61±5 m.y."" (Woodburne et al. 2014). This suggests the Peligran SALMA might be early Selandian in age. \r\n\r\nAccording to Andreis et al. (1975), the upper sectionof Salamanca Formation (= Hansen Member) in the San Jorge Gulf area was accumulated under infra-littoral and transitional sea conditions. The sediments were accumulated in low energy environments yielded by submarine bars or littoral banks that had reduced the circulation in a sea with little differences between high and low tides. Based on foraminifera, Bertels (1975) assigned the upper levels of the Salamanca Formation to the Upper Danian. This hypothesis was supported by the 40K/40A isotopic age of 61 ± 5Ma obtained from a vitreous tuff belonging to the Hansen Member at the Ca˜nad´on Hondo locality (Andreis 1977; Marshall et al. 1981). This age was subsequently corrected to 62.6 ± 5Ma byMarshall (1982). Additionally, two more reliable radiometric ages sampled by Marshall et al. (1981) in two basaltic units at or just under the base of the Salamanca Formation yielded ages of 64.0 ± 0.8Ma and 62.8 ± 0.8 Ma. Marshall et al. (1981, 1997) used these ages and palaeo-magnetic data to refer the overlaying BNI to polarity subchron C26r (= Danian Stage).

A single bed, 50-70 cm thick, approximately 11m below the Friars-Stadium contact. Magnetochron C21n (early Lutetian) at the Computer Media section, according to Walsh et al. (2005). The land-mammal assemblage from locality 3278 contains the insectivore Crypholestes?, a genus apparently endemic to\r\nsouthern California and only confidently identifed from strata of early Uintan ""Age"" (middle Eocene) (Novacek, 1976). The fossil assemblage from locality SDSNH 3278 contains molluscan taxa indicative of the middle Eocene ""Transition Stage"" of West Coast provincial molluscan biostratigraphy (Clark and Vokes, 1936; as refined by Givens and Kennedy, 1979). In terms of correlation with the standard European section, Givens (1974), Givens and Kennedy (1979), Saul (1983), and Squires (1984, 1987) considered the middle Eocene ""Transition Stage"" to be correlative with the middle part of the Lutetian Stage. \r\n","Fine to medium sandstone, gray, fossiliferous, with basal cobble conglomerate. At the base of the fossiliferous bed is pebble conglomerate with fossils tightly packed in among the clasts as whole and fragmented shell material. The pebble conglomerate grades upward into a pebbly sandstone where shells are unoriented and ""floating"" in the matrix. The lower contact of the bed is undulatory and erosional, and the upper contact is gradational.

It was previously dated by pollen analysis, mammal stratigraphy, and an unpublished radiometric K/Ar analysis as late Paleocene (see Kedves & Russell 1982). However, several lines of more recent evidence indicate an older, middle Paleocene (Selandian) age, of about 60-61 Ma. Paleomagnetic studies reveal that the eruption took place during a reversed interval (Kedves & Russell 1982). Fossils of the mammal Plesiadapis from Menat enable the locality to be connected to the biostratigraphic framework established in the Western Interior USA that relies extensively on this genus (Gingerich 1976; Secord et al. 2006). The abundance of the genus, its rapid evolution, and its Holarctic dispersal history allow species of Plesiadapis to play an important role in the zonation of Paleocene continental sediments and in correlation of faunas on both sides of the North Atlantic (e.g., Gingerich 1976). Two remarkable skeletons of P. insignis, one of them nearly complete, have been found in lake deposits at Menat, and this species closely compares to P. praecursor / P. anceps in North America (pers. comm. P. Gingerich August 2008). This suggests an early Selandian age, equivalent to the early Tiffanian Ti-1/Ti-2 land mammal biozonation sensu Secord et al. (2006) (see also Gingerich 1976; Russell 1967, 1975). In North America, the Ti1 and Ti2 biozones occur within magnetic polarity Chron 26r (Secord et al. 2006), consistent with the reversed polarity of the Menat sediments.","spongo-diatomitic","diatomite","","","","","","","","","","crater lake","volcanic basin","Volcanic Paleolake (maar) deposit","macrofossils,mesofossils","","","","","","","","mold/impression","","","","","","","","","","","","","taxonomic","field collection,survey of museum collection","MNHN","","","","Piton","","","","marine","","actively mobile","","","carnivore","","","","phosphatic","","",""

(2021). Our BTD results are also inconsistent with the latest Eocene and earliest Oligocene ages that Antoine et al. (2021) have proposed for the Shapaja localities. Though our analyses do not correctly predict the sequence of the Shapaja localities, the mean estimates for individual species nevertheless range from 31.6 to 20.7 Ma, with composite means for the section ranging from 29.1 to 28.3 Ma. The composite mean estimates for the Shapaja section are all very close to those for Santa Rosa, differing by only 0.42 to 1.0 My across analyses with both broad (effectively “unknown”) and more restricted age priors. These results are consistent with the close correlation of the Shapaja and Santa Rosa sections originally proposed by Boivin et al. (2018). Antoine et al. (2021) note that their placement of the Shapaja localities near the Eocene–Oligocene boundary implies that these faunas include 14 new first appearances in South America (either at the genus, family, or superfamily level), with most of the taxa in question otherwise first known from Deseadan (Upper Oligocene) localities.
